## How can I contribute to this project?

If you want to contribute code, please note that your code should fulfil the requirements set by CRAN. You can test that by running `R CMD check --as.cran source`. If this test throws errors, warnings or even notes, the package will be rejected by CRAN. This will cause problems with code that relies on packages from the tidyverse or on data.table.

### Test code

If you have an Octopus perimeter by Haag-Streit, you can also contribute by downloading the newest version of the package as shown above using install_github and testing the loadvfEyesuite function.

Export your visual field data from the Eyesuite software. In the menu, click `Perimetry -> Export examination data`. In window that comes up, you can input criteria to select visual fields. Currently, binocular visual fields will be ignored. When you are done, click the `Export examination` button at the bottom of the window. 

The data will be saved into a file that is pre-specified in the preferences menu. To change this file, click `Tools -> Preferences`, select `Perimetry -> Export` on the left and change the path and/or the name of  `Report file` on the right.
